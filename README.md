## Inspiration
A love of React & Redux design simplicity and a desire to learn more, combined with a need for a place to host a web app.
<br/></br>

## What It Does
* Teaches me about modern user interfaces.
* Provides fairly low-level insights into common UI/UX patterns.
* Hosts my personal web app, blog, resume, contact information, cool projects, etc.
* Serves as a testing area for anything I want to play around with.
